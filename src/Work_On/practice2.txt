I;m learning Git and GitHub

What is difference Git and GitHub?
While Git is a tool that's used to manage multiple versions of source code edits
that are then transferred to files in a Git repository,
GitHub serves as a location for uploading copies of a Git repository.
In a sense, then, there's no comparison when it comes to Git vs. GitHub as far as their function.
